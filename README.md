# javascript-challenge
The purpose of this project was to utilize JavaScript to present an interactive HTML table using data collected regarding United States UFO sightings from January 2010. The interactive table was then displayed in a github webpage. 


## Technologies

Since the baseline data was provided in the form of a JSON array, D3 was used to filter, generate, and format the table.
* JavaScript
* D3
* HTML

## Goals

1. Create and display an HTML table of all UFO sightings on web page initialization.
2. Allow users to filter the UFO sightings using one of the following parameters: date, city, state, country, and/or shape.

## Steps

1. Import the UFO sightings data from the JSON array.
2. Create a function to generate and display a table from the full JSON array.
3. Add filter input fields to the HTML web page for date, city, state, country, and shape.
4. Create a function to filter the JSON array based on user input, and generate and display the updated table.
