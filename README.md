# javascript-challenge
This assignment was the first test of JavaScript knowledge. 
Within javascript these files utilize D3, arrow functions, filtering, and table creation. 
The prompt for this assignment centered around worldwide UFO sightings and the data gathered regarding these alleged sightings (including: date, state, country, etc.). 
Data was stored within a javascript file, then accessed via the file app.js.
The UFO data was then filtered based on user input and printed to the webpage in tabular format.
